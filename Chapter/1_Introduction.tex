	In the past decade, business incubation programs have emerged as pivotal drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship worldwide. These programs provide startups with critical support, including funding, mentorship, and access to professional networks, which are essential for transforming innovative ideas into viable businesses. Among various types of incubators, University-Based Incubation Programs (UBIs) have gained prominence due to their unique position at the intersection of academia and industry.

	Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in academic research focused on UBIs. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ubi_publications_trend}, both the absolute number of published articles and their proportion relative to the broader literature have grown markedly since 2010, peaking around 2018â€“2019. This upward trend reflects the rising global interest in the role of UBIs in fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development. The growing body of literature underscores the importance of UBIs as a subject of scholarly inquiry and highlights their expanding influence within the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

	\end{figure}

	UBIs leverage university resources such as cutting-edge research, expert faculty, and a pool of talented students to nurture early-stage startups. According to the Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2023 by Startup Genome, startups that participate in university-affiliated incubators are 2.5 times more likely to secure follow-on funding compared to those outside such programs. This highlights the significant impact UBIs have on startup success rates.

	The theoretical foundation for this research is grounded in the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework, which posits that organizations gain competitive advantages through unique resource combinations and capabilities. In the context of UBIs, this framework helps explain how institutional resources such as funding mechanisms, mentorship programs, training initiatives, and networking opportunities contribute to startup performance. The mediating role of innovation capacity in this relationship represents a critical theoretical gap that this research addresses.

	\subsection{Practical Research Rationale}
	\label{subsection:1.1.2_Practical_research_rationale}
	In Vietnam, the startup ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with over 3,800 startups recorded in 2022, making it one of the most dynamic markets in Southeast Asia (Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology, 2022). Notable university incubators, such as the Saigon Hi-Tech Park Incubation Center (SHTP-IC) and the National University of Ho Chi Minh City's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, have played crucial roles in supporting startups like Abivin, which won the Startup World Cup 2019, and Logivan, which has raised millions in venture capital.

	Vietnamese universities, particularly Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), have become key players in fostering entrepreneurship, not just academic research. HUST established the BK Holdings Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, which has incubated dozens of technology startups and regularly organizes innovation competitions and startup bootcamps. For example, the "BK Fund" was launched in 2021 to invest in student and faculty-led startups, demonstrating the university's commitment to translating research into real-world entrepreneurial ventures.

	This trend aligns with the Vietnamese government's strong policy direction towards innovation and technology entrepreneurship. The government's National Innovation Center (NIC), established in 2019, and the "Supporting National Innovation Startup Ecosystem until 2025" (Project 844) are clear evidence of this commitment. These initiatives provide funding, infrastructure, and policy support to foster a vibrant startup ecosystem, with a particular focus on technology and digital transformation.

	Despite these successes, Vietnamese startups continue to face significant challenges, including limited access to high-quality mentorship, insufficient funding, and fragmented professional networks. A 2021 survey by Topica Founder Institute revealed that 70\% of Vietnamese startups identified mentorship and access to networks as the most critical factors for their growth, yet only 35\% felt they received adequate support in these areas.

	As the competition within the startup ecosystem intensifies, it becomes increasingly important to evaluate the effectiveness of UBIs in addressing these challenges. Understanding how factors such as mentorship quality, financial resource accessibility, and networking opportunities influence startup performance is essential for optimizing incubation strategies and ensuring sustainable growth. This research is motivated by the need to bridge the gap between academic research and entrepreneurial practice, ultimately enhancing the impact of UBIs on the Vietnamese innovation economy.

	\begin{condensed_idea}[Core Problem and Its Importance]
		The core problem addressed in this thesis is the limited understanding of how University-Based Incubation Programs (UBIs) impact startup performance in Vietnam, especially through mentorship, funding, and networking. This is critically important today as leading universities like Hanoi University of Science and Technology are increasingly driving entrepreneurship beyond academic research, and the Vietnamese government is actively promoting innovation and technology-based startups as national priorities. Optimizing UBIs will help maximize their effectiveness, support the country's innovation agenda, and foster sustainable economic growth.
